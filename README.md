# AudioTest

### An example of sound with SDL2 (no SDL_Mixer)
---

I just wrote this program as a proof of concept for using SDL2 audio functions instead of SDL_Mixer. This allows you to keep track of where you are in song1 and go to the same position in song2 (swap with space bar. It also allows 5 different enemy sounds to play (return key) and 5 different heart sounds to play (any other key).

### Requirements:
---

need SDL2

`make` to compile
